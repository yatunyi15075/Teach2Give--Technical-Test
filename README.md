## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the technical test questions provided by Teach2Give. These questions are part of the application process 
for the attachment with Teach2Give.

## Here are the Questions
The technical test consists of 6 questions. Each question is designed to test different aspects of programming knowledge and problem-solving skills.

Q1. **FizzBuzz**: Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz";

Q2. and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Q3. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to 100.

Q4. **Power of Two**: Write a Python function that takes an integer as input and returns true if the input is a power of two.

Q5. **Capitalize Words**: Write a Python function that accepts a string as input, capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string, and then returns the result string.

Q6. **Reverse Integer**: Write a Python function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer with reversed digit ordering.

Q7. **Count Vowels**: Write a Python function that counts the number of vowels in a sentence.

## Usage
To run each of the solution, simply execute the corresponding Python file on any python compiler. But personally I like Pycharm or VS code . Just Kidding
